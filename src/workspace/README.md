# Workspace & Memory System

Inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), the workspace provides persistent memory for agents with a flexible filesystem-like structure.

## Key Principles

1. **"Memory is database, not RAM"** - If you want to remember something, write it explicitly
2. **Flexible structure** - Create any directory/file hierarchy you need
3. **Self-documenting** - Use README.md files to describe directory structure
4. **Hybrid search** - Combines FTS (keyword) + vector (semantic) via Reciprocal Rank Fusion

## Filesystem Structure

## Using the Workspace

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use crate::workspace::{Workspace, paths};
use ironclaw_embeddings::{create_provider, EmbeddingCacheConfig, ProviderDeps};

// Construct an embedding provider through the factory — concrete provider
// types (OpenAI, NEAR AI, Ollama, Bedrock) are crate-private and must be
// reached via `create_provider`. The factory applies a baseline defense-
// in-depth URL check (rejects cloud-metadata IPs and non-http(s) schemes)
// and returns `None` when embeddings are disabled or misconfigured. The
// full operator-tunable SSRF policy lives in the binary's resolver at
// `src/config/embeddings.rs::resolve_embeddings_config`, which calls
// `validate_operator_base_url` on env-driven URLs before populating
// `EmbeddingsConfig`.
let embeddings = create_provider(
    &config.embeddings,
    ProviderDeps { session, bedrock_setup: None },
).await;

let mut workspace = Workspace::new("user_123", pool);
if let Some(emb) = embeddings {
    let cache = EmbeddingCacheConfig { max_entries: 1024 };
    workspace = workspace.with_embeddings_cached(emb, cache);
}

// For tests: skip the cache layer and use the deterministic mock
// (gated behind the `testing` feature on `ironclaw_embeddings`).
// use ironclaw_embeddings::MockEmbeddings;
// let workspace = Workspace::new("user_123", pool)
//     .with_embeddings_uncached(Arc::new(MockEmbeddings::new(1536)));

// Read/write any path
let doc = workspace.read("projects/alpha/notes.md").await?;
workspace.write("context/priorities.md", "# Priorities\n\n1. Feature X").await?;
workspace.append("daily/2024-01-15.md", "Completed task X").await?;

// Convenience methods for well-known files
workspace.append_memory("User prefers dark mode").await?;
workspace.append_daily_log("Session note").await?;

// List directory contents
let entries = workspace.list("projects/").await?;

// Search (hybrid FTS + vector)
let results = workspace.search("dark mode preference", 5).await?;

// Get system prompt from identity files
let prompt = workspace.system_prompt().await?;
```

## Memory Tools

Four tools for LLM use:

- **`memory_search`** - Hybrid search, MUST be called before answering questions about prior work
- **`memory_write`** - Write to any path (memory, daily_log, or custom paths)
- **`memory_read`** - Read any file by path
- **`memory_tree`** - View workspace structure as a tree (depth parameter, default 1)

## Hybrid Search (RRF)

Combines full-text search and vector similarity using Reciprocal Rank Fusion:

```
score(d) = Σ 1/(k + rank(d)) for each method where d appears
```

Default k=60. Results from both methods are combined, with documents appearing in both getting boosted scores.

**Backend differences:**
- **PostgreSQL:** `ts_rank_cd` for FTS, pgvector cosine distance for vectors, full RRF
- **libSQL:** FTS5 for keyword search + vector search via `libsql_vector_idx` (dimension set dynamically by `ensure_vector_index()` during startup)

## Multi-Scope Reads & Identity Isolation

When a workspace has additional read scopes (via `with_additional_read_scopes`), read operations can span multiple user scopes — a user with scopes `["alice", "shared"]` can read documents from both.

**Identity files are exempt from multi-scope reads.** The system prompt reads identity and configuration files from the **primary scope only** (`read_primary()`), never from secondary scopes:

| File | Read method | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| AGENTS.md | `read_primary()` | Agent instructions are per-user |
| SOUL.md | `read_primary()` | Core values are per-user |
| USER.md | `read_primary()` | User context is per-user |
| IDENTITY.md | `read_primary()` | Identity is per-user |
| TOOLS.md | `read_primary()` | Tool config is per-user |
| BOOTSTRAP.md | `read_primary()` | Onboarding is per-user |
| MEMORY.md | `read()` | Shared memory is a feature |
| daily/*.md | `read()` | Shared daily logs are a feature |

**Why:** Without this, a user with read access to another scope could silently inherit that scope's identity if their own copy is missing. The agent would present itself as the wrong user — a correctness and security issue.

**Design rule:** If you want shared identity across users, seed the same content into each user's scope at setup time. Don't rely on multi-scope fallback for identity files.

**Embeddings providers:**
- **NEAR AI** - reuses the session auth path
- **OpenAI** - uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Ollama** - local embedding server
- **AWS Bedrock** - Titan Text Embeddings V2 with Bedrock region/profile auth

## Heartbeat System

Proactive periodic execution (default: 30 minutes):

1. Reads `HEARTBEAT.md` checklist
2. Runs agent turn with checklist prompt
3. If findings, notifies via channel
4. If nothing, agent replies "HEARTBEAT_OK" (no notification)

```rust
use crate::agent::{HeartbeatConfig, spawn_heartbeat};

let config = HeartbeatConfig::default()
    .with_interval(Duration::from_secs(60 * 30))
    .with_notify("user_123", "telegram");

spawn_heartbeat(config, workspace, llm, response_tx);
```

## HDC Fingerprinting (Optional)

Behind the `hdc` feature flag, workspace memory gains hyperdimensional computing fingerprints for deduplication and novelty detection. When enabled, fingerprints are computed and stored alongside documents without changing existing behavior until explicitly activated.

**Modes:**

- **Shadow mode** (`IRONCLAW_HDC_FINGERPRINT_SHADOW=true`): computes and stores 10,240-bit fingerprints on write without altering behavior. Use this to evaluate HDC quality before enabling active modes.
- **Write-time dedup** (`IRONCLAW_HDC_DEDUP_MODE=warn|block`): blocks duplicate writes or warns on similar content based on normalized Hamming similarity thresholds.
- **Search fusion** (`IRONCLAW_HDC_SEARCH_SHADOW=true`): computes HDC normalized Hamming similarity as an additional search signal. Shadow mode annotates results without reordering; live mode applies a small score boost.
- **Heartbeat novelty** (`HEARTBEAT_HDC_ENABLED=true`): detects repeated observations in heartbeat runs, optionally suppressing already-reported findings.

See `crates/ironclaw_hdc/CLAUDE.md` for crate internals and the fingerprint encoding format.

## Chunking Strategy

Documents are chunked for search indexing:
- Default: 800 words per chunk (roughly 800 tokens for English)
- 15% overlap between chunks for context preservation
- Minimum chunk size: 50 words (tiny trailing chunks merge with previous)
